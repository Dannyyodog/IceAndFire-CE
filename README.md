## FAQ

### Will new contents in 1.21.1 be updated in 1.20.1?

No. 1.20.1 now only receive bug fixes since parallel update is very hard.

### Other Minecraft Version?

This mod is planned to be updated to the later Minecraft version after bugs are resolved and some rewrites completed.

I'm not planning to backport the mod, but anyone can do it.

### I cannot find config file

As the config system is based on `Jupiter`, the config will only save needed data. You can change config by using client
side GUI through mod menu. (Requires server operator permission.)

### How to change biome configs

Change biome tags by using datapacks.

**Please DO NOT report any issue to the original mod!**
